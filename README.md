# VPS and cloud GPU Instance Initialization Scripts

Public helper scripts to quickly initialize remote linux server instances, e.g. runpod or various VPS

Each script will have its own instructions but generally you can run something like:
```
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vijay-prema/instance-init/refs/heads/main/setup_runpod.sh | bash
```
